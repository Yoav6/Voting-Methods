# Voting-Methods

This is a repository for voting method simulations I write. 'Sequential Proportional 3-2-1 Voting' is a method I developed based on 3-2-1 voting and Sequential Proportional Approval Voting. You can read about all of those here: https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aA5bSGmAN7SXiPkQC/multi-winner-3-2-1-voting

The code for 'Sequential Proportional 3-2-1 Voting' can also run the single winner version of the variable 'seats' is set to 1. The files don't reference each other, so they're independent.

P.S: Not the prettiest code, but it works.
